&lt;p&gt;
There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in &lt;a href=&quot;/PLANT/NEW-IMAGE?type=ECOCYC-CLASS&amp;object=mRNAs&quot; title=&quot;The class of all messenger RNA molecules.&quot;&gt;mRNA&lt;/a&gt; during protein biosynthesis.
&lt;p&gt;
The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2203971&quot;&gt;Eriani90&lt;/a&gt;]. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1103137&quot;&gt;Sprinzl75&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/319826&quot;&gt;Chinault77&lt;/a&gt;]. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers [&lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi00875a037&quot;&gt;Griffin66&lt;/a&gt;]. 
&lt;p&gt;
The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
The structure shown here depicts the phosphate group at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule, which binds the amino acid (in the form of an amino-acyl group).</comment>
