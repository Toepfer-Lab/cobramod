"""CobraMod Package

CobraMod is a tool for pathway-centric metabolic network curation and extension
based on COBRApy. This package facilitates the retrieval of biochemical data
from multiple databases and help users extend metabolic networks.

CobraMod ensures an easy-friendly API, customization and a record of all the
changes made to metabolic models.

Important functions from CobraMod that can be imported directly:

- get_data: Store and retrieve data from given database.
- create_object: Create a corresponding COBRApy object from given identifier.
- add_metabolites: Add metabolites from different objects
- add_reactions: Add reactions from different objects
- add_pathway: Extend given pathway into given model.
- test_non_zero_flux: Test given reaction to check for a feasible solution.
- add_crossreferences: Check for cross-references.

The exclusive class :func:`cobramod.pathway.Pathway` is an extension of
:class:`cobra.core.group.Group`. CobraMod uses :mod:`Escher` to visualize
the pathway and fluxes of that specific class. Some new methods added:

- visualize: Return a Builder for the representation of the pathway.
- solution: Filters solution and returns fluxes of only members of the class.

By default, CobraMod creates the file "debug.log", which displays the changes,
which occurred when running a script. In order to modify the logging, import
"debug_log" from "cobramod.debug". The default logging level is defined as
INFO. Read the documentation of logging for more information.

For a list of databases, load variable :obj:`cobramod.available_databases`
