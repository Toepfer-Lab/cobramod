In the following, only BioCyc is discussed, as it requires special treatment

In order to access BioCyc, a license is required. CobraMod offers the ability to utilize
stored login credentials for authentication. This can be achieved by generating a file
named 'credentials.txt' that includes the username and password, and placing it in the
directory from which CobraMod is run. Here's an example of the proper formatting for this file.

.. code-block:: text

   <Username>
   <Password>
