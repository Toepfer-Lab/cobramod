CobraMod: A pathway-centric curation tool for constraint-based metabolic models
===============================================================================

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Toepfer-Lab/cobramod/master/docs/source/img/logo.png)

CobraMod is a Python 3 open-source package for pathway-centric curation of
genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). It builds upon the [COBRApy toolbox]
(https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/) and offers a comprehensible set of
functions for semi-automated network extension, curation and visualization.
CobraMod supports all databases from the [BioCyc collection](https://
biocyc.org/), the [KEGG database](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/), and the [BiGG
Models repository](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/). It optionally can interact with
Escher for pathway and flux visualization.

This package converts pathway information into native COBRApy objects and
quality-checks them while adding them to the model. This includes testing for:

-   duplicate elements
-   correct chemical formula
-   mass balance of reactions
-   reaction reversibility
-   capability to carry non-zero fluxes
-   adding available gene information
-   MEMOTE compliance
-   available cross-references

CobraMod offers user-friendly tracking of the curation process with summary
output with log files and customized pathway and flux visualization with
[Escher](https://escher.github.io/).

Installation
------------

CobraMod can easily be installed using pip :

    pip install cobramod

Functions
---------

This package offers multiple functions for modifying and extending GEMs:

-   Retrieve metabolic pathway information from a database `cobramod.get_data`
-   Transform stored data into COBRApy objects `cobramod.create_object`
-   Add metabolites from multiple sources `cobramod.add_metabolites`
-   Add reactions from multiple sources `cobramod.add_reactions`
-   Test reaction capability to carry a non-zero flux
    `cobramod.test_non_zero_flux`
-   Add pathway to a model `cobramod.add_pathway`
-   Automatic cross-references `cobramod.add_crossreferences`
-   Testing for MEMOTE compliance
