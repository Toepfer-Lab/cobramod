CobraMod: A pathway-centric curation tool for constraint-based metabolic models
===============================================================================

</div>

CobraMod is a Python 3 open-source package for pathway-centric curation of
genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). It builds upon the 
[COBRApy toolbox](https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/) and offers a 
comprehensible set of functions for semi-automated network extension, curation and visualization.
CobraMod supports all databases from the [BioCyc collection](https://biocyc.org/), 
the [KEGG database](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/), and the [BiGG
Models repository](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/). It optionally can interact with
Escher for pathway and flux visualization.

This package converts pathway information into native COBRApy objects and
quality-checks them while adding them to the model. This includes testing for:

-   duplicate elements
-   correct chemical formula
-   mass balance of reactions
-   reaction reversibility
-   capability to carry non-zero fluxes
-   adding available gene information
-   MEMOTE compliance
-   available cross-references

CobraMod offers user-friendly tracking of the curation process with summary
output with log files and customized pathway and flux visualization with
[Escher](https://escher.github.io/).

Installation
------------

CobraMod can easily be installed using pip :

    pip install cobramod

Functions
---------

This package offers multiple functions for modifying and extending GEMs:

-   Retrieve metabolic pathway information from a database `cobramod.get_data`
-   Transform stored data into COBRApy objects `cobramod.create_object`
-   Add metabolites from multiple sources `cobramod.add_metabolites`
-   Add reactions from multiple sources `cobramod.add_reactions`
-   Test reaction capability to carry a non-zero flux
    `cobramod.test_non_zero_flux`
-   Add pathway to a model `cobramod.add_pathway`
-   Automatic cross-references `cobramod.add_crossreferences`
-   Testing for MEMOTE compliance

Development
-----------
CobraMod consists of a Python and JavaScript/TypeScript part. 
The following briefly describes all the commands to build a local 
version from the source files.

### JavaScript

Since we need Node modules to build the Jupyter integrations con CobraMod, 
a package.json is included in the project. All dependencies contained 
in it can be made available locally using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). The foiling command can be used for this:

    yarn install

We use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to build the Javascript part of the Jupyter integrations. So, we can use the following command to build a bundled version of the integrations.

    yarn run vite build

This creates bundled JavaScript files under '/src/cobramod/static'.

### Python

You can contribute to CobraMod by cloning the repository and installing it in
developer mode and using the `dev` dependency group via pip:

    pip install -e ".[dev]"

Optionally, a conda environment file is supplied (*environment.yml*). This
file contains all the dependencies to ensure reproducibility of the package. We
encourage pull requests!
